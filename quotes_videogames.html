        William Miles - After all, I've seen the truth. That's the beauty and the horror of the animus. A device that allows us to enter and experience the lives of our ancestors. It holds the power to change everything. To show his history the way really happened. Up until it's creation, to the victor went the spoils - went the truth.

        Abbas - Silence is just another form of a sin.

        Wheatley - You know what I have too many of around here? Monitors. I was just thinking earlier today I wish I had fewer monitors that were working. So you're actually helping me by smashing them.

        Wheatley - You two are going to *love* this big surprise. In fact, you might say that you're going to love it... to death. Love it... until you're, until it kills you. Until you're dead. Alright? I don't know whether... you're, uh, you're picking up on what I'm saying there, but...
