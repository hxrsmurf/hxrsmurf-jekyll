        Ronald Spiers - Well, maybe that's because Tertius knew there was some value to the men thinking he was the meanest, toughest son of a bitch in the whole Roman Legion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lt. Winters - I cherish the memories of a question my grandson asked me the other day when he said, "Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?" Grandpa said "No... but I served in a company of heroes."

        Raymond Tusk - Decisions based on emotion aren't decisions, at all. They're instincts. Which can be of value. The rational and the irrational complement each other. Individually they're far less powerful.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - Moments like this require someone like me. Someone who will act. Who will do what no one else has the courage to do. Someone who will do the unpleasant thing. The necessary thing.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power. In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the Mc-mansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - There are two kinds of pain. The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain. The sort of pain that's only suffering. I have no patience for useless things.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - You see, Freddy believes that if a fridge falls off a minivan, you better swerve out of its way. I believe it's the fridge's job to swerve out of mine.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - After all, we are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal. What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe, just as Zoe is not to me what she is to her father.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - There's no better way to over power a trickle of doubt then with a flood of naked truth.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Doug Stamper - But the most important count I do has nothing to do with work. It's the number of days since April 4, 1999. As of this morning, that's 5,185. The bigger that number gets, the more it frightens me, because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero. Most people see fear as a weakness. It can be. Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people. I know that's not right. But if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be, I have to be ruthless, because failure is not an option. The same goes for my sobriety. I have to be ruthless with myself. I have to use my fear. It makes me stronger. Like everyone in this room, I can't control who I am. But I can control the zero. Fuck the zero.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - How quickly poor grades are forgotten in the shadow of power and wealth.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - Kindness isn't kindness if you expect a reward.
    </p>

        Francis Underwood - Rebellion on all fronts Claire, Zoe, Russo.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - She knows the right questions to ask. I want to make sure she doesn't get the right answers.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - If we're lucky, it'll be anthrax and I won't live long enough to see the bill fail.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis - If we never did anything we shouldn't do, we'd never feel good about doing the things we should.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Claire - He made the world a better place, but sometimes that comes at a price.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - Presidents who obsess over history obsess about their place in it, instead of forging it.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Dan - I'll let you know when I give a fuck about your respect.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - This hurts us both. Its not my wound to suture. Claire must be the surgeon. Only she can stop the bleeding.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties. Never regret.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Freddy - I ain't over for looking back. Eyes ahead.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - I've always loathed the necessity of sleep. Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Remy - I care more about you more than I should. But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - I've managed to isolate the president from everyone, including myself.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - If you don't like how the table is set, turn over the table.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Janine - My entire career, I have always chosen the tough stories. I have been fearless. But you know what? I'm really fucking scared this time. He's got power, he's got a lot to lose, and right now he is winning.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Francis Underwood - A flat-line will send a louder message than life support.

        Alan Eppes - I think that people like that, like this woman, they're just looking for something, they're looking for answers, you know, maybe even some of the answers that you are, but just by, uh, different means... It's just that, um, not everyone has the emotional and intellectual resource to search for God in a super collider. People look for answers in what's available to them, and when they're particularly desperate, they larch on to the closest answer that's available. I mean, it may make them wrong but not necessarily evil.

    <p>
        Ron Swanson - The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.
    </p>

        Ron Swanson - That's what you do when you care about someone. You support 'em. Win, lose, or draw.

    <p>
        Ron Swanson - Food is for eating, places are for being. End of discussion.

        Michael - The things we *should* say. We speak in code, we send little messages. Origami... So now, plainly, simply, I want to say that I love you both. Very much. And I want you to promise me, that you are going to tell my child... that you are going to tell my child how much they're loved, every day, and remind them how lucky they are to be free. Because we are. We are free now. Finally! We're free.
