        Patrick Verona and Cameron James - Cameron, do you like the girl? </br> Yeah.</br> And is she worth all this trouble?</br> I thought she was, but, you know, I-</br> Well, she is or she isn't. See, first of all, Joey is not half the man you are. Secondly, don't let anyone ever make you feel like you don't deserve what you want.

        Steve Rogers - Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.

        Thomas Wayne - And why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Henri Ducard - No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed, or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, and if they can't stop you, then you become something else entirely.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Bruce Wayne - I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Henri Ducard - You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600. You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

    <p>
        Alfred - I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Rachel - We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared, no one'll touch him. Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone. What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?
    </p>    

    <p>
        Henri Ducard - To conquer fear, you must become fear.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Henri Ducard - Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.

        Bruce Wayne - That's why it's so important. It separates us from them.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Bruce Wayne - People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol. As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.
    </p>

        Lucius Fox - The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Rachel Dawes - Bruce deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be. But it's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Alfred - It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Henri Ducard - Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
    </p>

        Two-Face - You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time. But you were wrong. The world is cruel, and the only morality in a cruel world is chance. Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Commissioner James Gordon - Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Joker - I took Gotham's white knight and I brought him down to our level. It wasn't hard. You see, madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push!

        Joker - All you care about is money. This town deserves a better class of criminals and I'm going to give it to them.

Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.

        Niki Lauda - A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends.

        Niki Lauda - But trust me...watching you win those races while I was fighting for my life, you were equally responsible for getting me back in the car.
    </p>    

    <p>
        Niki Lauda - I accept that every time I get into my car, there's 20% chance I could die and I could live with it, but not one percent more! And today with the rain, the risk is more.

        James Hunt - I tend to enjoy myself first. The sum of life needs to be pleasure. What's the point of having a million of medals, cups and planes if you don't have any fun? And how is that winning?

        Jigsaw - You see things aren't sequential. Good doesn't lead to good nor bad to bad. People steal, don't get caught. Live the good life. Others lie, cheat and get elected. Some people stop to help a stranded motorist and get taken out by a speeding semi. There's no accounting for it. How you play the cards you're dealt, that's all that matters.

        Han - I have money, it's trust and character I need around me. You know, who you choose to be around you lets you know who you are. One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.

    <p>
        Cutter - Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts.</br></br>
The first part is called "The Pledge." The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. </br></br>
The second act is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. </br></br>
That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige."

        Alfred Borden - Never show anyone. They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret, but as soon as you give it up... you'll be nothing to them.

    <p>
        Alfred Borden - The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything.

        Mr. Nobody - It's ironic, isn't it? The Old Testament had a wrathful God, but people became uneasy with the concept, needed a best seller, so they came up with a New Testament. Suddenly God was loving and forgiving. I'm old-school, myself. I prefer the Old Testament. I mean you've got to love a God who's not afraid to mete out a little vengeance when the need arises.
