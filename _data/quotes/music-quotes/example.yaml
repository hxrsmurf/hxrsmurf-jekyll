- lyric: >
    Two lives, living two lives</br>
    I don't know which side of me is where the truth lies

- lyric: And the love kick starts again

- lyric: >
    There's a million words but it's never enough</br>
    I say, 'I love you', 'I'm sorry' but still I get stuck</br>
    If I had a coin for every time, we could be millionaires</br>
    But you don't need the diamonds</br>
    'Cause I got a million ways to show you that I care</br>

- lyric: >
    I'll probably lose you again for a day, maybe 10</br>
    We're broken for a minute, doesn't mean it's the end</br>

- lyric: >
    Cause deep down you're my girl in a golden crown</br>
    My princess and I don't wanna let you down
