- lyric: Why be a king when you can be a God?

- lyric: >
    I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain</br>
    An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling</br>
    But don't think I ever stopped</br>
    To think I was speaking to children

- lyric: >
    And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me</br>
    As we pulled off to go our separate paths,</br>
    And I saw your headlights as I looked back</br>
    And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

- lyric: >
    I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek</br>
    Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey</br>
    Wanted to receive attention for my music</br>
    Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
