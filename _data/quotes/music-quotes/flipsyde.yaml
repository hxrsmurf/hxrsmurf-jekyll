- lyric: >
    Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know</br>
    Someday we gonna dance with those lions</br>
    Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'

- lyric: >
    Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen</br>
    Happy birthday, love you whoever you woulda been</br>
    Happy birthday...
