- lyric: >
    Stop it don't look at the gunmen,</br>
    You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',</br>
    If you gonna run or not,</br>
    'Cause if you run then you might get shot,</br>
    Other than that try not to think about it,</br>
    Try not to worry 'bout it; bein' so crowded,</br>
    Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.
