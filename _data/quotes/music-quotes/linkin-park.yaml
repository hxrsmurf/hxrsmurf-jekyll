- lyric: When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.

- lyric: >
    So you can let it be known</br>
    I don't hold back, I hold my own</br>
    I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned</br>
    I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone</br>
    I can't fall back, I came too far

- lyric: >
    I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end.</br>
    I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend</br>
    You'll never know what I became because of you</br>
    Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose
