- lyric: > 
    We'll be miles apart</br>
    I'll keep you deep inside</br>
    You're always in my heart</br>
    A new life to start</br>
    I may be leaving but you're always in my heart


- lyric: >
    I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do</br>
    Follow me there</br>
    A beautiful somewhere</br>
    A place that I can share with you


- lyric: I only need one more day; Just one more chance to say; I wish that I had gone up with you too
- lyric: You are my only, my only one
- lyric: The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away
