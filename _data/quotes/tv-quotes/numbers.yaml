  quote: I think that people like that, like this woman, they're just looking for something, they're looking for answers, you know, maybe even some of the answers that you are, but just by, uh, different means... It's just that, um, not everyone has the emotional and intellectual resource to search for God in a super collider. People look for answers in what's available to them, and when they're particularly desperate, they larch on to the closest answer that's available. I mean, it may make them wrong but not necessarily evil.
