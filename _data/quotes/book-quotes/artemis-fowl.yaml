- quote: I have another chance, and I will not waste it on greed. We are a family now. A proper one. From now on the Fowl name will be associated with honour and honesty.
  person: Artemis Fowl Sr.
- quote: While I was a prisoner, I thought about my life, how I had wasted it gathering riches whatever the cost to my family and others around me. In a man's life, he gets a few chances to make a difference. To do the right thing. To be a hero, if you will. I intend to become involved in that struggle. I never got involved before. I always thought the world could not be changed. But things are different now. My priorities are different. I intend to seize the day. Be the hero that every father should be. And what about you, Arty? Will you make the journey with me? When the moment comes, will you take your chance to be a hero? (Eternity Code, P.156)

- quote: ."I can't be sure," the centaur replied. "But I'm guessing that Holly's magic wasn't enough. Some of Butler's own life force was needed for the healing. About fifteen years' worth by the looks of it."
  person: Foaly
- quote: Koboi? Koboi? Those wings of hers are ridiculous. If you ask me, we’re using far too much Koboi technology these days. It’s not good to let one company have all LEP’s business.

- quote: Those on the fringes of the law move faster than those bound by it, which is where I come in.
  person: Foaly
- quote: For a job like this, we need our very best. And that's me. I'm reactivating myself.
  person: Commander Root
- quote: That would spell the end of everything, unless the Mud People had learned to coexist with other species. And if history had taught any lessons it was that humans couldn't get along with anyone, even themselves.
  person: Commander Root
- quote: Well, there’s a big difference between stunning a cardboard cutout and a real person.
  person: Commander Root
- quote: How far was he prepared to go for this gold? He didn't know, and wouldn't until the time came.
  person: Artemis
- quote: Ah yes, the trusty time paradox. If I go back in time and kill my grandfather, then shall I cease to exist? I believe, as Gorben and Berndt did, that any repercussions are already being felt. We can only change the future, not the past or present. If I go back, then I have already been back.

  person: Holly
- quote: We could never have been friends. It was circumstance that pushed us together, nothing more.
  person: Holly (Eternity Code, P.302)
- quote: Friendship is not a science, Mud Boy. Forget about your massive brain for one minute. Just do what you feel is right.

  person: Dr. Po
- quote: Two hundred goblins versus our virtually unarmed three heroes. It was going to be close.
  person: Narrator
- quote: But Mulch quickly discovered that Mud People could find a reason to distrust almost anyone. Height, weight, skin colour, religion. It was almost safer to be different in some way
  person: Narrator
- quote: It was an electric moment. Not only because Pex had actually had an idea, but because it was actually a good one.
  person: Narrator (Eternity Code, P.255)
- quote: Ambition had a price, and that price was friendship.
  person:  Narrator Cudgeon 
- quote: I'm worried about you, Arty. Someone your age shouldn't be quite so...responsible. Don't worry about us; worry about school and friends. Think about what you really want to do. Use that big brain of yours to make yourself and other people happy. Forget the family business. Living is the family business now.
  person: Angeline Fowl (Opal Deception, P.95)
- quote: ."No, you don't," he grunted, tightening his inhidden grip. "I've put up with too much hardship over the years for you to disappear on me now." And so Butler reached down through the decades and yanked his young charge back from the past.
